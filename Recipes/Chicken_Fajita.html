    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 lime</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the fajitas seasoning ingredients to a small mixing bowl and stir together.</li>
        <li>Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both sides of the chicken and use your fingers to press it into the chicken.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sear the chicken breasts for about 7-8 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>While your chicken is cooking, cut the bell peppers and onion into thin slices.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken has finished cooking, remove it to a plate and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Add the bell peppers and onion to the same skillet over medium heat and saute for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>When the bell peppers are just about done sauteing, slice the chicken breasts into strips.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back into the skillet, add a squeeze of fresh lime juice and stir everything together.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with tortillas and extra toppings such as sour cream, pico de gallo and guacamole.</li>
